<p><span style="border:1px solid">The first time I heard about codeHive scholarship I was excited and curious to explore more on my computer skills. </span><span style="border: 1px solid;">I applied from home online with my best friend and the only thing that I was thinking was moving to Nairobi and complete my course.</span> I didn't realise that I was moving apart from my home, friends and society that i used to live together untill the day I recieved an email confirming my application to codeHive programming. But as bieng an expert at comuter skills is my biggest dream I had to make the right descision that leads me to the future successful me. I got the courage to move forward and the best thing is all my family was happy about it that they put all their effort to suport me.</p>

<p>When I arrived to Nairobi Internatinal Airport it was about midnight that I didn't see any places on my way to AkiraChix University. The Alumuni welcomed us in a way that makes us feel home and gave us our dinner though I wasn't satisfied as I used to. It was not easy for me not to eat injera because my whole life was dependant on that meal.</p>
